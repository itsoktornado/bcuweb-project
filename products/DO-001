DESCRIPTION
Pups love exploring the great outdoors, and when they find something new, they like to mark their discovery. Frisco Premium Training & Potty Pads are like a personal patch of grass right at home, just waiting to be discovered. That’s why they’re the best spot in the house. These affordable potty pads have an effective built-in dog attractant that’s ideal for training puppies, but also entices indoor pets so they know exactly where to go. With five layers of durable protection to lock in wetness, a leak-proof plastic lining and a fast-drying quilted top layer to prevent tracking, Frisco Premium Training & Potty Pads absorb the mess, making waste pickup easy and ensuring that your floors and the surrounding areas stay dry.
