DESCRIPTION
- Exclusive design provides 3 different water settings to entice selective drinkersâ€”choose between a gentle flow, bubbling top or calm stream.
- With no bowl for the water to pool in and a superior filter, this fountain keeps dirt, debris and other nasties out of your kitty's water.
- Easily remove and re-attach the flower to strengthen or lessen the bubble flow when in the "bubbling top" mode.
- Fountain is simple to assemble and disassemble for cleaning, so there's less hassle for you and more irresistibly clean water for her.
- Made of BPA-free materials to be extra-safe and non-toxic for your best bud.
Picky drinker? Not anymore! Your favorite friend's water bowl will look and sound like an inviting, bubbling brook when you use the Flower Pet Fountain by Catit. This innovative fountain encourages your pal to drink more water, keeping her healthy and hydrated using a unique, customizable design. With three water flow settings, you can switch between a gentle flow of water, a bubbling top, or faucet-like streams. So, you can entice your fussy pet to drink. While she enjoys the seemingly never-ending flow of water, a triple-action filter removes magnesium, calcium, odors and debris. Unlike most drinking fountains, this flower doesn't have a bowl for dirt to settle in and get comfortable. Instead, your pet is always drinking from a clean, fresh stream. That's what we call flower power!
