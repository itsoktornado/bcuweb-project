DESCRIPTION
Provide your purring pal with peak nourishment from ORIJEN Fit & Trim Grain-Free Dry Cat Food. Your cat is an obligate carnivore, which means that she thrives on a biologically appropriate diet that’s packed with protein and fat from a variety of animal ingredients. This scrumptious kibble is optimized to support lean muscle mass and peak physical conditioning with fresh or raw free-run chicken and turkey, cage-free eggs and wild-caught fish. Crafted with the most nutrient-dense and succulent parts of the prey, this recipe is also made with WholePrey animal ingredients, including organs and bone, delivering 85% quality animal ingredients. And for added flavor, this kitty kibble is coated with freeze-dried liver! ORIJEN’s fresh ingredients use refrigeration as the sole method of preservation and their raw ingredients are frozen at their peak freshness!
