DESCRIPTION
Same great kibble, just a new name! Cat & Kitten is now Original Cat. Provide your purring pal with peak nourishment from ORIJEN Original Grain-Free Dry Cat Food. Your cat is an obligate carnivore, which means that she thrives on a biologically appropriate diet that’s packed with protein and fat from a variety of animal ingredients. This scrumptious kibble features fresh or raw free-run chicken and turkey, wild-caught fish and cage-free eggs. Crafted with the most nutrient-dense and succulent parts of the prey, this recipe is also made with WholePrey animal ingredients, including organs and bone, delivering 90% quality animal ingredients. And for added flavor, this diet is coated with freeze-dried liver! ORIJEN’s fresh ingredients use refrigeration as the sole method of preservation and their raw ingredients are frozen at their peak freshness!
