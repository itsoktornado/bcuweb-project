If there was an amusement park for kitties, this toy would be the main attraction. That’s because these tracks have everything cats love—a ball to bat and chase around the tracks, the excitement of the rolling sound, and even a fluttery butterfly on top! There are three levels for even more play, each with its own rolling ball, so even more than one kitty can get in on the fun. Go ahead, let them go wild. The nonskid pads keep the track from sliding around when playtime goes into overtime.
