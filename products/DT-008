DESCRIPTION
With the Dura Brite treat ball from Ethical Pet, playtime merges with snack time. Load one of these colorful toys with your dog's favorite treats or kibble, and watch as the interior maze releases them slowly while she plays. It's made with pure, thermo-plastic rubber—which is great for massaging gums—and non-toxic. Let your pup take on the challenge herself, or make an interactive game to play alongside her. Either way, the Dura Brite ball is sure to bust boredom and satisfy the urge to snack.
